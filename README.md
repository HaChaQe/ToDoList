# ToDoList
Basic To-Do List site written in html, css and js.
The project contains several parts:
- Add/remove/complete tasks.
- Delete all tasks.
- Filter by task completion.

!! Dear programmer friend !!
When the page is refreshed, completed tasks are loaded in an uncompleted state.
It's probably a local storage issue.
If you know how to solve it, you can send a pull request.

--HAPPY CODING--
